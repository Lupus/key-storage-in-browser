Key Management in the Browser
=============================

Securely store cryptographic keys within the browser using IndexedDB. The
sample application allows key pairs to be created and saved, shows all saved
keys, and allows public keys to be downloaded for external use.

Using this example requires a web browser that implements a compatible version
of the Web Cryptography API. When the example was created, current versions of
the Google Chrome browser and the Opera Developer release, and recent nightly
builds of the Firefox browser, could run the example.

**This is not intended to be a production tool.** Rather, it may
be helpful to developers who intend to create their own tools using
the Web Cryptography API.
